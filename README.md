# Posted Notes

## Introduction
Posted Notes is an ethical note-sharing platform that facilitates the legal exchange of student notes with the permission of instructors. It allows students to sell their notes online while ensuring that instructors have control over the content shared within their courses.

## Features
- User Profile: Users can create profiles including information about the courses they've taken, graduation date, college, etc.
- Verification Process: Users are required to verify their identity using their school ID to ensure accountability for their products.
- Instructor Profile: Instructors can create profiles detailing the courses they teach, and whether they allow note-sharing for those courses.
- Course Profile: Courses taught by instructors who allow note-sharing will be visible. Clicking on them will allow users to see uploaded notes (blurred until payment).
- Ratings: Buyers can rate sellers' notes, and average ratings will be displayed on user profiles to establish credibility.
- Payment Structure: Payment is facilitated through Visa, Plaid, or another API. The platform charges a 5% fee, with 95% going to the seller.

## Usage
1. Create a user account and verify your identity.
